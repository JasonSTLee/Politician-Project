# politician-project-data-analytics

## An in-depth look at the purchasing and selling history of senators and house of representatives all to answer a very simple question: Is the stock performance of politicians abnormally high? Does it indicate insider trading?

### Tools/Languages: 
- Google Sheets 
- PostgreSQL
- Tableau


### This project aims to showcase my skills with the above mentioned tools and to craft a data-driven story that uncovers insights previously unknown. 

#### This is an updated section on the main branch in which I 1) extracted stock/ticker information from the Alpha Vantage API instead of this [website](http://finance.jasonstrimpel.com/bulk-stock-download/) 2) Didn't delete any transactions that had no corresponding stock close information like I did on the main branch. This would give a more accurate view of Nancy Pelosi's portofolio performance without having to compromise on deleting transactions. I am also showcasing my Python skills with: Loops and the Pandas Libraries.
