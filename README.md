# Nancy Pelosi Portfolio Performance

#### This is a separate, albeit, a more concise and organized branch from the main in which I am only analyzing and focusing on Nancy Pelosi's transactions. 

#### This is an updated section on the main branch in which I 1) extracted stock/ticker information from the Alpha Vantage API instead of this [website](http://finance.jasonstrimpel.com/bulk-stock-download/) 2) Didn't delete any transactions that had no corresponding stock close information like I did on the main branch. This would give a more accurate view of Nancy Pelosi's portofolio performance without having to compromise on deleting transactions. I am also showcasing my Python skills with: Loops and the Pandas Libraries. 

#### The portoflio return calculation is in the sql file titled 'final_output.sql' and the Python api extraction code is 'api_politician.ipynb' file.
